# Eimer Drink Tracker - Keep the Rounds Straight! üçªü§ò

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

So, you're heading down to the **Eimer** in Freiburg for a night of good music[cite: 2, 3], maybe some Kicker[cite: 3], and definitely a few rounds with your mates? Awesome! But who had what? How many Pils[cite: 130], Hefeweizen[cite: 138], Guinness[cite: 158], or maybe even an Absinthe[cite: 334]? Did someone _really_ order that many Mexikaner[cite: 677]?

Fear not, this little app is here to save your beer-soaked napkin calculations! Built specifically for keeping tabs on who's drinking what at the legendary Eimer Music Pub[cite: 2].

## What's this thing do then? ü§î

- **Friend Zone:** List who's in your drinking crew for the night.
- **Drink Log:** Quickly tap in who grabbed which brew (or shot, or longdrink...) using the actual Eimer drink list[cite: 1].
- **Damage Report:** See a running log of the orders. No more "Did _I_ order that?" arguments.
- **The Reckoning:** Get a summary of drinks per person and the total cost. Settle up without the headache (well, _that_ headache anyway).
- **Dark Mode:** Because staring at a bright screen in the glorious dimness of the Eimer is just wrong. Toggle it on! üåô
- **It Remembers!** Uses your browser's `localStorage`, so even if you accidentally refresh after that _one_ extra shot, your tab should still be there.

## Features on Tap üç∫

- Add/Select friends joining the session.
- Browse/Search the _actual_ Eimer drink menu (extracted from their site! [cite: 1]).
- Assign drinks to the selected person.
- View a real-time order log.
- Remove mistaken orders (we've all been there).
- See a summary breakdown per person and total cost.
- Light/Dark theme toggle.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`.
- Responsive design for mobile use (because who brings a laptop to the pub?).
- Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack Fueling This Engine üõ†Ô∏è

- **React** with **Vite** (Keeps things speedy)
- **TypeScript** (To try and keep the bugs out)
- **CSS Modules** (Keeps the styles from fighting each other)
- **GitHub Actions** (For automatic deployment)
- Pure digital elbow grease & possibly some caffeine[cite: 5, 362].

## Deployment üöÄ

Make sure your `vite.config.ts` has the correct `base` path set!

Now, go forth, enjoy the Eimer, and keep track responsibly (or at least, _accurately_)! Prost! üçª
